Our platform connects data across channels, predicts future behavior with AI, and individualizes experiences from a single platform. \n\nWe have just celebrated our $500M Series E funding round, led by General Atlantic. Before this, we’ve unlocked unicorn status following our Series D round. We are backed by top-notch investors, including Sequoia Capital, QIA, Riverwood, and Endeavor Catalyst, and trusted by 1200+ brands from high-growth startups to the most prestigious Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung, Coca-Cola, Nike, L’Oreal, Singapore Airlines, Virgin, Nestle, Nissan, Lenovo, Puma, IKEA, Allianz, Dominos, CNN, and the list goes on.\n\nHaving unlocked unicorn status, Insider was congratulated for becoming one of the only woman-founded, women-led B2B SaaS unicorns in the world, to achieve $200M in CARR (Committed Annual Recurring Revenue). Insider was named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Cross-Channel Campaign Management 2021, and Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Omnichannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises 2023 Assessment. The company has been recognized in The Top 1% of all software companies worldwide in G2’s 2024 Software Awards, and named in The Top 10 Best Software Products with the most #1 rankings alongside other software legends like Google, Zoom, and Monday.com. According to G2’s Spring’24 reports. Insider is also the #1 G2 Leader in 6+ categories, including Customer Data Platforms (CDP), Personalization Engines, Personalization Software, Mobile Marketing, Customer Journey Analytics, and e-commerce Personalization.\n\nWhen our team founded Insider, they not only sought to create a product company but also to build the most socially progressive technology community in the world. Through our corporate social responsibility initiatives like 100Projects SheCodes, SheLeads, and SheMarkables, our community has committed to scaling its impact into our communities across 27+ countries, spearheading transformative projects in areas such as health, education, farming, animal rights, and increasing the proportional representation of women in STEM careers. \n\nBehind all these achievements, there is an exceptionally talented and passionate team across 27+ countries that moves fast and agile, creates cutting-edge products, and focuses on making an impact. If you want to join us on this journey, just keep reading.\n\n\nWhat is this role about?\n\nYou’re probably expecting an eye-catching, mesmerizing job description that will sweep you off your feet, flavoured with the coolest startup jargon. After all, we’re a Sequoia-backed company, with an awarded woman CEO and a team across the globe that takes the word “diversity” very seriously. But that’s exactly why we think nothing says more than the real experience. We’re underdogs who believe in the power of actions more than anything else. And as a customer-first company, we always walk the extra mile. So we asked our team of Technical Support Specialists (TSS) to tell us what their day-to-day is really like and, in a nutshell, this is what they told us.\n\nRole Description\n\nAs a Technical Support Engineer, you will play a crucial role in the Operational Excellence Team that owns support processes with our partners using our products and services. To succeed in this role you should be an excellent communicator with solid problem-solving skills.         \n\nYour primary responsibility will be to support seamless experiences for our partners. Your day-to-day responsibilities will include troubleshooting technical issues, finding resolutions for partner requests, reviewing partner queries and finding creative solutions that streamline their requirements, and leveraging your knowledge to help partners overcome technical struggles while expanding to the Insider platform. You will also contribute to building innovative products by advocating for partners by taking their feedback and sharing it with the Product team to improve processes and product offerings. Another important duty of yours will be meeting important SLAs like response time and the lead time for issue resolutions.\n","description":"<div>Before jumping in on all the information about the role and what you can bring to the table, let us introduce ourselves real quick.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About us</b></div><div><br></div><div>We are Insider, a B2B SaaS company that drives growth for its clients around the world.
