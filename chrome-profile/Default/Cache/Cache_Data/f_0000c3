We are the #1 AI-native platform for Customer Experience and Marketing—offers marketers a single platform to deliver unique experiences per person, drive profitable growth, and unleash peak productivity and efficiency. Our platform connects data across channels, predicts future behavior with AI, and individualizes experiences from a single platform. \n\nWe have just celebrated our $500M Series E funding round, led by General Atlantic. Before this, we’ve unlocked unicorn status following our Series D round. We are backed by top-notch investors, including Sequoia Capital, QIA, Riverwood, and Endeavor Catalyst, and trusted by 1200+ brands from high-growth startups to the most prestigious Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung, Coca-Cola, Nike, L’Oreal, Singapore Airlines, Virgin, Nestle, Nissan, Lenovo, Puma, IKEA, Allianz, Dominos, CNN, and the list goes on.\n\nHaving unlocked unicorn status, Insider was congratulated for becoming one of the only woman-founded, women-led B2B SaaS unicorns in the world, to achieve $200M in CARR (Committed Annual Recurring Revenue). Insider was named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Cross-Channel Campaign Management 2021, and Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Omnichannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises 2023 Assessment. The company has been recognized in The Top 1% of all software companies worldwide in G2’s 2024 Software Awards, and named in The Top 10 Best Software Products with the most #1 rankings alongside other software legends like Google, Zoom, and Monday.com. According to G2’s Spring’24 reports.

Through our corporate social responsibility initiatives like 100Projects SheCodes, SheLeads, and SheMarkables, our community has committed to scaling its impact into our communities across 27+ countries, spearheading transformative projects in areas such as health, education, farming, animal rights, and increasing the proportional representation of women in STEM careers. \n\nBehind all these achievements, there is an exceptionally talented and passionate team across 27+ countries that moves fast and agile, creates cutting-edge products, and focuses on making an impact.

We are the #1 AI-native platform for Customer Experience and Marketing—offers marketers a single platform to deliver unique experiences per person, drive profitable growth, and unleash peak productivity and efficiency. Our platform connects data across channels, predicts future behavior with AI, and individualizes experiences from a single platform. \n\nWe have just celebrated our $500M Series E funding round, led by General Atlantic. Before this, we’ve unlocked unicorn status following our Series D round. We are backed by top-notch investors, including Sequoia Capital, QIA, Riverwood, and Endeavor Catalyst, and trusted by 1200+ brands from high-growth startups to the most prestigious Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung, Coca-Cola, Nike, L’Oreal, Singapore Airlines, Virgin, Nestle, Nissan, Lenovo, Puma, IKEA, Allianz, Dominos, CNN, and the list goes on.\n\nHaving unlocked unicorn status, Insider was congratulated for becoming one of the only woman-founded, women-led B2B SaaS unicorns in the world, to achieve $200M in CARR (Committed Annual Recurring Revenue). Insider was named a leader in The Forrester Wave for Cross-Channel Campaign Management 2021, and Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Omnichannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises 2023 Assessment. The company has been recognized in The Top 1% of all software companies worldwide in G2’s 2024 Software Awards, and named in The Top 10 Best Software Products with the most #1 rankings alongside other software legends like Google, Zoom, and Monday.com. According to G2’s Spring’24 reports. Insider is also the #1 G2 Leader in 6+ categories, including Customer Data Platforms (CDP), Personalization Engines, Personalization Software, Mobile Marketing, Customer Journey Analytics, and e-commerce Personalization.\n\nWhen our team founded Insider, they not only sought to create a product company but also to build the most socially progressive technology community in the world. Through our corporate social responsibility initiatives like 100Projects SheCodes, SheLeads, and SheMarkables, our community has committed to scaling its impact into our communities across 27+ countries, spearheading transformative projects in areas such as health, education, farming, animal rights, and increasing the proportional representation of women in STEM careers. \n\nBehind all these achievements, there is an exceptionally talented and passionate team across 27+ countries that moves fast and agile, creates cutting-edge products, and focuses on making an impact. If you want to join us on this journey, just keep reading.\n\n\nSo… you’re wondering what is this role about?\n\nTo be honest, we are not looking for an Inside Sales Associate, that’s merely a title. What we are looking for is Hunger! For people who are hungry to go out a play in the major leagues even though they have no name, to sit down and drive results that create an impact, and to go out of their way to get things done when it matters most. We’re looking for freshers who possess the energy, the passion, the drive, but most importantly, the desire to prove themselves and create an impact. \n\nThis is a role that can be considered the backbone of sales at Insider. A crucial part of this role is to identify and reach out to prospective sales opportunities. This is where our ‘growth’ begins.  \n\nWe also realize that most Job Descriptions almost always sound like the description of an A-380 but when you’ve arrived at the airport what you find is a Cessna twin-seater! We want to write a JD that’s realistic and as close to the real thing as possible. How can we do this? So, we thought about it and realized that the best JD for this role is one that comes from the insights of other Inside Sales specialists.
